## Hi, I'm Nullspeaker.
__Government Name:__ Nicholas Hammond\
__Preferred Name:__  Auralyn (or just Aura for short)

I'm a maths enthusiast and software developer. \
I don't have much industry experience[^1], but I'm comfortable hacking around with anything and everything.

Currently doing freelance work!

Feel free to contact me about anything that might interest me.\
I'm slow at checking my personal email, so if you want a within-a-day response, ping me on Discord.

If you want to support my projects, thank me for some help, or just want me to eat more cheese, I'm accepting financial support via [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nullspeaker) and [paypal](paypal.me/nullspeaker). :)
